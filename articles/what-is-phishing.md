Phishing is a cybercrime in which a target or targets are contacted by email,
telephone or text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution to lure
individuals into providing sensitive data such as personally identifiable
information, banking and credit card details, and passwords.

The information is then used to access important accounts and can result in
identity theft and financial loss.

The first phishing lawsuit was filed in 2004 against a Californian teenager who
created the imitation of the website “America Online”. With this fake website,
he was able to gain sensitive information from users and access the credit card
details to withdraw money from their accounts. Other than email and website
phishing, there’s also 'vishing' (voice phishing), 'smishing' (SMS Phishing) and
several other phishing techniques cybercriminals are constantly coming up with.

## Common Features of Phishing Emails

1. Too Good To Be True - Lucrative offers and eye-catching or
   attention-grabbing statements are designed to attract people’s attention
   immediately. For instance, many claim that you have won an iPhone, a
   lottery, or some other lavish prize. Just don't click on any suspicious
   emails. Remember that if it seems to good to be true, it probably is!

2. Sense of Urgency - A favorite tactic amongst cybercriminals is to ask
   you to act fast because the super deals are only for a limited time.
   Some of them will even tell you that you have only a few minutes to
   respond. When you come across these kinds of emails, it's best to just
   ignore them. Sometimes, they will tell you that your account will be
   suspended unless you update your personal details immediately. Most
   reliable organizations give ample time before they terminate an account
   and they never ask patrons to update personal details over the
   Internet. When in doubt, visit the source directly rather than clicking
   a link in an email.

3. Hyperlinks - A link may not be all it appears to be. Hovering over
   a link shows you the actual URL where you will be directed upon
   clicking on it. It could be completely different or it could be a
   popular website with a misspelling, for instance
   www.bankofarnerica.com - the 'm' is actually an 'r' and an 'n', so
   look carefully.

4. Attachments - If you see an attachment in an email you weren't
   expecting or that doesn't make sense, don't open it! They often
   contain payloads like ransomware or other viruses. The only
   file type that is always safe to click on is a .txt file.

5. Unusual Sender - Whether it looks like it's from someone
   you don't know or someone you do know, if anything seems
   out of the ordinary, unexpected, out of character or just
   suspicious in general don't click on it!

## Prevent Phishing Attacks:

Though hackers are constantly coming up with new techniques, there are some
things that you can do to protect yourself and your organization:

- To protect against spam mails, spam filters can be used. Generally, the
  filters assess the origin of the message, the software used to send the
  message, and the appearance of the message to determine if it’s spam.
  Occasionally, spam filters may even block emails from legitimate sources, so
  it isn’t always 100% accurate.

- The browser settings should be changed to prevent fraudulent websites
  from opening. Browsers keep a list of fake websites and when you try to
  access the website, the address is blocked or an alert message is shown.
  The settings of the browser should only allow reliable websites to open
  up.

- Many websites require users to enter login information while the
  user image is displayed. This type of system may be open to security
  attacks. One way to ensure security is to change passwords on a
  regular basis, and never use the same password for multiple
  accounts. It’s also a good idea for websites to use a CAPTCHA system
  for added security.

- Banks and financial organizations use monitoring systems to
  prevent phishing. Individuals can report phishing to industry
  groups where legal actions can be taken against these fraudulent
  websites. Organizations should provide security awareness
  training to employees to recognize the risks.

- Changes in browsing habits are required to prevent phishing.
  If verification is required, always contact the company
  personally before entering any details online.

- If there is a link in an email, hover over the URL
  first. Secure websites with a valid Secure Socket Layer
  (SSL) certificate begin with “https”. Eventually all
  sites will be required to have a valid SSL.

Generally, emails sent by a cybercriminals are masked so they appear to be sent
by a business whose services are used by the recipient. A bank will not ask for
personal information via email or suspend your account if you do not update your
personal details within a certain period of time. Most banks and financial
institutions also usually provide an account number or other personal details
within the email, which ensures it’s coming from a reliable source.
