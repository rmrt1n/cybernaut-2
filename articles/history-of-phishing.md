As widespread and well-known as phishing is now, it hasn’t been around forever.
Although the practice originated sometime around the year 1995, these types of
scams were not commonly known by everyday people until nearly ten years later.

That doesn’t mean that phishing was not a force to be reckoned with right from
the start. In order to avoid falling prey to such scams yourself, it is helpful
to have a basic understanding of the history behind them. 

## Name Origins

Phishing scams use spoofed emails and websites as lures to prompt people to
voluntarily hand over sensitive information. It isn’t surprising, then, that the
term “phishing” is commonly used to describe these ploys. There is also a good
reason for the use of “ph” in place of the “f” in the spelling of the term. Some
of the earliest hackers were known as phreaks. Phreaking refers to the
exploration, experimenting and study of telecommunication systems. Phreaks and
hackers have always been closely linked. The “ph” spelling was used to link
phishing scams with these underground communities.

##First Recorded Mention

According to Internet records, the first time that the term “phishing” was used
and recorded was on January 2, 1996. The mention occurred in a Usenet newsgroup
called AOHell. It is fitting that it was made there too; America Online is where
the first rumblings of what would become a major criminal issue would take
place.


## Phishing’s America Online Origins

Back when America Online (AOL) was the number-one provider of Internet access,
millions of people logged on to the service each day. Its popularity made it a
natural choice for those who had less than pure motives. From the beginning,
hackers and those who traded pirated software used the service to communicate
with one another. This community was referred to as the warez community. It was
this community that eventually made the first moves to conduct phishing
attacks.

The first way in which phishers conducted attacks was by stealing users'
passwords and using algorithms to create randomized credit card numbers. While
lucky hits were few and far between, they struck the jackpot often enough to
cause a lot of damage. The random credit card numbers were used to open AOL
accounts. Those accounts were then used to spam other users and for a wide
range of other things. Special programs like AOHell were used to simplify the
process. This practice was put to an end by AOL in 1995, when the company
created security measures to prevent the successful use of randomly generated
credit card numbers.

## Phishing Attacks Begin

With their random credit card number generating racket shut down, phishers
created what would become a very common and enduring set of techniques. Through
the AOL instant messenger and email systems, they would send messages to users
while posing as AOL employees.

Those messages would request users to verify their accounts or to confirm their
billing information. More often than not, people fell for the ruse; after all,
nothing like it had ever been done before. The problem intensified when
phishers set up AIM accounts through the Internet; such accounts could not be
“punished” by the AOL TOS department. Eventually, AOL was forced to include
warnings on its email and instant messenger clients to keep people from
providing sensitive information through such methods.


## The Evolution of Phishing

In many ways, phishing hasn’t changed a lot since its AOL heyday. In 2001,
however, phishers turned their attention to online payment systems. Although
the first attack, which was on E-Gold in June 2001, was not considered to be
successful, it planted an important seed. In late 2003, phishers registered
dozens of domains that looked like legitimate sites like eBay and PayPal if
you weren't paying attention. They used email worm programs to send out
spoofed emails to PayPal customers. Those customers were led to spoofed sites
and asked to update their credit card details and other identifying
information.

By the beginning of 2004, phishers were riding a huge wave of success that
included attacks on banking sites and their customers. Popup windows were used
to acquire sensitive information from victims. Between May 2004 and May 2005,
about 1.2 million users in the U.S. suffer losses caused by phishing, totaling
approximately $929 million. Organizations lose about $2 billion per year to
phishing.

Phishing is officially recognized as a fully organized part of the black
market. Specialized software emerges on a global scale that can handle
phishing payments, which in turn outsources a huge risk. The software is
implemented into phishing campaigns by organized crime gangs.

In late 2008, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are launched. This allows
transactions using malicious software to be secure and anonymous, changing the
game for cybercriminals.


## Phishing and Ransomware

In September of 2013, Cryptolocker ransomware infected 250,000 personal
computers, making it the first cryptographic malware spread by downloads from
a compromised website and/or sent to victims in the form of two different
phishing emails. The first email had a Zip archive attachment that claimed to
be a customer complaint and targeted businesses, the second had a malicious
link with a message regarding a problem clearing a check and targeted the
general public. Once clicked, Cryptolocker scrambles and locks files on the
computer and demands the owner make a payment in exchange for the key to
unlock and decrypt the files. 


## Current Phishing Threats

Phishers start adopting HTTPS more and more often on their sites starting in
2017. When you click on a phishing link, the sites they lead to—that try to
trick you into entering credentials, personal information, and so
on—implement web encryption at least 24 percent of the time. The green
padlock gives consumers a false sense of security. All it really tells
us is that traffic between the server and the user's browser is
encrypted and protected against interception. 

A phishing campaign targeting organizations associated with the 2018
Winter Olympics is the first to use a PowerShell tool called
Invoke-PSImage that allows attackers to hide malicious scripts in the
pixels of otherwise benign-looking image files, and later execute them
directly from memory. Hiding the script inside an image file not only
helps it evade detection, executing it directly from memory is a
fileless technique that in most cases won't get picked up by
traditional antivirus solutions. This is another troubling example of
how attacks are staying under the radar and evolving away from using
malicious .exe's.

Conversation hijacking, a style of phishing email in which hackers
insert themselves into email conversations between parties known to
and trusted by one another, starts being used. Once in, hackers
exploit that trust to trick users to launch an executable. Variations
of this scheme are very difficult to detect and beat. 

In 2018, researchers discover a new generation of phishing kit readily
available on the Dark Web to cybercriminals. The kit enables anyone
who downloads it to easily craft convincing emails and redirect sites
that closely mimic branding elements of well-known firms and launch a
phishing campaign that collects the personal and financial information
of unsuspecting targets.

Gift card phishing campaigns that started in 2018 continued to evolve
in 2019. The bad guys got much better at establishing a credible
pretext (ie "incentives"), explicitly request confidentiality, they
got very greedy -- up to $4000 per request in gift cards, and they are
incentivizing the entire scheme by offering the recipient a bribe
("take one for yourself"), a ploy which, in a way, seeks to turn the
target into a co-conspirator.

A devilishly ingenious vishing scam plays on your user’s familiarity
with business voicemail, seeking to compromise online credentials
without raising concerns. Many organizations have their PBX system
integrated with email; miss a call and the recording pops into your
Inbox. Nothing inappropriate with this scenario. But, that’s exactly
what scammers are hoping you’ll think when your users receive their
email pretending to be an internal voicemail notification. Using
subjects such as Voice:Message, Voice Delivery Report, or PBX Message,
these emails contain another email as the attachment (to avoid
detection by email scanning security solutions) containing the actual
phish.

Vendor email compromise emerged as a new type of attack in 2019, which
is a variety of business email compromise (BEC) attack (or CEO Fraud).
Cybercriminals gain access to email accounts at a company in their
supply chain, then use the accounts to target that company’s
customers. The attacks focus on organizations with global supply
chains and attempt to trick a supplier’s customers into paying fake
invoices. Vendor email compromise impacted at least 500 organizations
globally in 2019.

According to Microsoft, some of the innovative ways they’ve seen
phishing attacks evolve so far in 2020 include:  Pointing email links
to fake Google search results that point to attacker-controlled
malware-laden websites, pointing email links to non-existent pages on
an attacker-controlled website so that a custom 404 page is presented
that can be used to mimic logon pages for legitimate sites, spoofing
company-specific Office 365 sign-in pages to look so realistic that
users would think it's the real thing. 

In early 2020, phishing emails related to the C-19 pandemic start
running rampant. Popular themes include stimulus checks, fake CDC
warnings, working from home, Netflix scams, fines for coming out of
quarantine and many more. Every country in the world has been affected
by these types of attacks.

These advancements in the way attackers are thinking about phishing to
facilitate endpoint infection or credential theft make it absolutely
necessary for organizations to no longer consider their security
solutions as their only line of defense. Users must become the last
line of defense, playing a role in organizational security.
